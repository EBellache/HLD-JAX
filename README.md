# 🚀 JAX-Based Holographic Projection & Geodesic Solver
### **Unifying Quantum Mechanics, Contact Geometry, and Lie Algebra in a High-Performance Computational Framework**

## 🔹 Overview
This repository provides a **GPU-accelerated JAX-based framework** for simulating **Holographic Projections, Macroscopic Quantum Potential (MQP), Bohmian Geodesics, and Lie Algebra Symmetries** in fundamental physics.

### **Key Features**
- **Holographic Fourier Projection (HFP):** Quantum wavefunction emerges as a Fourier projection.
- **Bohmian Mechanics & Pilot-Wave Theory:** Particles have deterministic trajectories guided by the MQP.
- **Macroscopic Quantum Potential (MQP):** Governs geodesic motion in projection space.
- **Contact Geometry & Lie Groups:** Structures quantum evolution and symmetry constraints.
- **GPU-Accelerated Geodesic Solver:** Computes particle motion with JAX-optimized numerics.

## 🔹 Mathematical Foundations
### **1️⃣ Holographic Fourier Projection (HFP)**
Quantum mechanics is derived as an **artifact of Fourier interference** from projection constraints:

$$
\Psi(x, t) = \sum_k A_k e^{i(kx - \omega_k t)}
$$

📌 **Emergent Quantum Effects:**
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Interference generates probability densities.
- **Quantum Foam:** Small-scale interference patterns mimic vacuum fluctuations.
- **Entanglement:** Phase-locking in Fourier modes correlates nonlocal wavefunctions.

### **2️⃣ Bohmian Mechanics & Deterministic Quantum Evolution**
Instead of a probabilistic collapse, particles **follow deterministic Bohmian trajectories** governed by:

$$
v(x,t) = \frac{\hbar}{m} \nabla S
$$

where \( S \) is the **holographically projected wavefunction phase**.

### **3️⃣ Macroscopic Quantum Potential (MQP)**
The MQP acts as a **guiding potential** modifying geodesic evolution:

\[
Q(x) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\nabla^2 |\Psi|}{|\Psi|}
\]

This potential is **computed dynamically in the geodesic solver**.

### **4️⃣ Contact Geometry & Lie Algebra Constraints**
Quantum evolution follows **contact geometry equations**, ensuring non-equilibrium behavior:

$$
\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}, \quad \frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} + \lambda p, \quad \frac{dS}{dt} = p \frac{dq}{dt} - H
$$

📌 **Lie Group Contributions:**
- **SU(N) Symmetries:** Govern internal gauge interactions.
- **E8 Breaking:** Defines fundamental force emergence from projection.

### 💾 Running a Simulation

Example: Solve a Bohmian geodesic in the projection space

```bash
import jax.numpy as jnp
from geodesics.geodesic_solver import solve_geodesic

metric_tensor = jnp.eye(4) # Projection space metric
x0 = jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]) # Initial position
v0 = jnp.array([0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1]) # Initial velocity

trajectory = solve_geodesic(x0, v0, metric_tensor, num_steps=500, dt=0.005)

print("Geodesic Trajectory (First 10 Steps):")
print(trajectory[:10])
```
